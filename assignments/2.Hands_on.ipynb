Data cleaning involves the identification and correction of errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data collected from various sources, such as governments, companies, and non-profit organizations.\n","\n","One significant difference between clean numerical data and text data is the nature of the data itself. Numerical data refers to data that consists of numbers, such as financial data or survey responses, while text data refers to data that consists of text or written language, such as news articles or social media posts.\n","\n","The cleaning process for numerical data typically involves identifying and removing outliers, inconsistencies, and errors in the data, such as missing or incorrect values. This process often involves statistical techniques to identify patterns or trends in the data and to remove any data points that do not fit these patterns. Once the data has been cleaned, it can be used for analysis and reporting.\n","\n","On the other hand, cleaning text data involves identifying and correcting errors in the text, such as spelling and grammatical errors, and removing any irrelevant or redundant information. This can be a more subjective process than cleaning numerical data, as it requires a human editor to review the text and make decisions about what information to include or exclude.\n","\n","Another important difference between clean numerical data and text data is the types of analysis that can be conducted with each type of data. Numerical data is often used for statistical analysis, such as regression analysis or hypothesis testing, while text data is often used for sentiment analysis or natural language processing.\n","\n","In conclusion, while both numerical data and text data require cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability, the cleaning process for each type of data is different due to the nature of the data itself. Additionally, the types of analysis that can be conducted with each type of data may vary, making it important to understand the differences between the two."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wTfIFZI67ML4"},"source":["##**Cleaning numerical data**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OAt-6og9lVjm"},"source":["Data Cleaning for Numerical Data\n","\n","Dataset:\n","\n","The dataset you will be using is a IMDB movies dataset.
